INTELLIGENT INSTANT BRICK KILNS MACHINE USING IOT
Now-a-days a clay bricks kilns is possible by using large quantity of wood. To kiln the 60 thousand of bricks approximately 9 tones of wood is required and also it takes 15 to 20 days of duration. Many trees are cut down to satisfy the requirement. As a result we are significantly contributing in global warming and polluting the atmospheric air much more. It is unable to kiln the less quantity of bricks. Investment of bricks manufacturing is also more (including maintenance and labour). In the traditional way of brick kilns there is 5% of bricks were wasted. The emission of carbon is also more. It is completely manual process. Here, we are with a solution of proposal “INTELLIGENT INSTANT BRICK KILNS MACHINE”, we can get instantly finished bricks from the machine by using electrical furnace. We can reduce the deforestation and emission of harmful gases from the kilning process. The main objective of this project is to get a instant of bricks in a machine without any loss and pollution.
